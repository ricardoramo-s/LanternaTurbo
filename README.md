Lanterna is a Java library allowing you to write easy semi-graphical user interfaces in a text-only environment,
very similar to the C library [curses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)) but with more functionality.
Lanterna is supporting xterm compatible terminals and terminal emulators such as konsole, gnome-terminal, putty, xterm and many more.
One of the main benefits of lanterna is that it's not dependent on any native library but runs 100% in pure Java.

Thing is, we don't need all of the capabilities of Lanterna, so here is Lanterna Turbo, a really crippled version of Lanterna that exists with the sole purpose of drawing large amounts of colored spaces to the screen.

Maven
---

Lanterna Turbo is available right here! No Maven Central version, this comes with the satisfaction of building the library yourself!:
